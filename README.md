Note:

**Presentation Equipment.** All assigned conference spaces/rooms are equipped with a PC computer, projector, and screen for your In-Person presentation purposes. We do not have Apple computers so if you have software that runs on Apple you need to bring your own equipment and needed wires and have it installed well before your presentation.

**Power Point Presentation.** As a backup plan and for your convenience at the time of presentation, we suggest you email yourself and us a digital copy of your PowerPoint Presentation in case you face difficulty in accessing your file at the conference.

**Presentation Time.** Given sessions are 90-minutes long and have four presentations in them, the maximum time for your presentation is 22.5 minutes. This includes time for in-session Qs&As. We suggest you present your work in around 15 minutes so a minimum of seven (7) minutes left for the assigned Discussant. Sessions’ Chairs will keep track of time for each presentation. So please plan accordingly.

This page is for the session only and will be down on Fri, 22 Sep 2023, at 3:30 pm PDT UTC-7.
